## Hi I am Martin Skermont 
# Projects WireShark, RangeForce, Comptia  

## Objective
I have done projects in Rangeforce and using Wireshark in linux, Comptia projects security+ learning terms and commands 
### Skills Learned
- Using Wireshark to determine cyber attacks
- I have the knowledge to be able to find solutions to certain situations 
- Knowledge in reconnaisance and undertsanding how attackers think 
- The ability to create virtual labs
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Linux Kali and Ubuntu
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
- Creating directories and subdirectories
- analyzing data from trace commands and ping from the terminal
- Jack the Ripper
- Metasploitable 

## Steps
In projects like Wireshark using it and using it on either what ever traffic you want to see then filtering out traffic to see if maybe there is to much traffic coming from a device that shouldn't be could be a determination of an attack on the company. Using the terminal to collect infromation and create bash script files helps to create easy codes to input in to see what is happening on a interface so it can do a list of commands in order.
